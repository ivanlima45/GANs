MO433 - Machine Learning Probabilistic Fundamentals

This repository contains the finalk project of the Unsupervised Learning course taken at the Computational Institute of the University of Campinas.

Code in python and report in latex.

The purpuse of the project is to implement GANs used in unsupervided learning.

See the final_project.pdf for more details.

The project members are the following:

Ivan Lima do Espirito Santo (ivanlimasanto@gmail.com)

Rosa Yuliana Gabriela Paccotacya Yanque (r263068@dac.unicamp.br)
